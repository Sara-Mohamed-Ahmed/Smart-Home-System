In this Smart Home system we utilized: 
-LCD to display all relevant information.
-Servo motor as the door.
-DC motor as a fan.
-LEDs were used to represent different rooms, with an additional LED outside the house controlled by an LDR sensor for automatic light adjustment.
-LM35 Sensor to enhance safety: if the temperature exceeds 30Â°C, the fan activates, and if it surpasses 70Â°C, a buzzer and a red LED are triggered.
Finaly when the user enters the incorrect username or the password 3 times the warning will be triggeredðŸš¨!!
